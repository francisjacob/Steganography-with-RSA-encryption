# Steganography with RSA encryption

Steganography is the art of hiding text in images. 
The algorithm also implements an RSA encryption algorithm before embedding the text into the image.
The Steganography algorithm uses LSB replacement.
The algorithm is developed in a model-view-controller format.
To run the code
  1)Compile all the java classes
  2)Run Steganography_Controller class.
